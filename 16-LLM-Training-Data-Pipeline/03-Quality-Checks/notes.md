# Quality Checks

> _"Filtering is not cleaning; it is choosing which errors the model is allowed to learn from."_

## Overview

Quality checks estimate which records increase effective training signal and which
records inject noise, risk, or distributional distortion. In an LLM training run, data
is not an inert pile of text; it is the empirical distribution that defines the
examples, losses, risks, and capabilities the model will see.

This section is written as LaTeX Markdown. Inline mathematics uses `$...$`, and display
equations use `$$...$$`. The goal is to connect data engineering decisions to
mathematical objects such as records $r_i$, token sequences $x_{1:T}$, filters $f(x)$,
hashes $h(x)$, mixture weights $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$, and empirical expectations.

The scope is deliberately narrow: this chapter owns the training-data pipeline.
Tokenizer design, GPU training systems, benchmark methodology, alignment objectives, and
production MLOps each have their own canonical chapters. Here we study the data objects
that those later systems consume.

## 1. Intuition

Intuition gives the conceptual and mathematical layer for quality checks. The local
variables in this section should be read as pipeline objects: documents, records,
tokens, filters, weights, shards, and manifests.

### 1.1 Quality as effective token multiplier $D_{\mathrm{eff}}=qD$

Quality as effective token multiplier $D_{\mathrm{eff}}=qD$ is part of the canonical
scope of quality checks. We model the relevant object as a finite collection
$\mathcal{D} = \{r_i\}_{i=1}^n$ with record-level metadata $m_i$ and text or token
content $x_i$. The practical question is whether the transformation preserves the
intended empirical distribution.

A useful local invariant is:

$$
\text{valid}(r_i, \mathcal{S}) = 1 \quad \Longrightarrow \quad r_i \text{ can be consumed by the next pipeline stage.}
$$

For `quality score`, the invariant should be explicit enough that a checker can fail
fast. If the invariant is only written in a notebook comment or an engineer's memory, it
will not protect a long-running data build.

Examples:
- A small local experiment can store this object in memory; a frontier-scale run must store it as sharded, versioned, validated records.
- The mathematical object is simple, but the operational contract must survive restarts, parallel workers, schema changes, and audits.
- The notebook for this section uses synthetic data so the same ideas can be executed without external files.

Non-examples:
- A path on disk without a manifest is not a reproducible dataset.
- A metric dashboard without record-level lineage is not a provenance system.
- A filter threshold without an audit sample is not evidence of quality.

Implementation consequence: every transformation should report both a count and a rate.
If $n_{\mathrm{in}}$ records enter the stage and $n_{\mathrm{out}}$ records leave, the
acceptance rate is

$$
a = \frac{n_{\mathrm{out}}}{n_{\mathrm{in}}}.
$$

A sudden change in $a$ is a data-drift signal even when the code still runs. This is why
pipeline math is inseparable from logging, manifests, and audit slices.

For LLM work, the token-weighted view is often more important than the document-weighted
view. A filter that removes 5 percent of documents may remove 30 percent of tokens if it
targets long documents. The corresponding token acceptance rate is

$$
a_{\mathrm{tok}} = \frac{\sum_i f(r_i)\,T_i}{\sum_i T_i},
$$

where $T_i$ is the token count or a deterministic token-count estimate. The distinction
matters for compute budgets, mixture proportions, and scaling-law interpretation.

### 1.2 Filtering as precision/recall tradeoff

Filtering as precision/recall tradeoff is part of the canonical scope of quality checks.

A useful local invariant is:

$$
\text{valid}(r_i, \mathcal{S}) = 1 \quad \Longrightarrow \quad r_i \text{ can be consumed by the next pipeline stage.}
$$

For `filter`, the invariant should be explicit enough that a checker can fail fast. If
the invariant is only written in a notebook comment or an engineer's memory, it will not
protect a long-running data build.

Examples:
- A small local experiment can store this object in memory; a frontier-scale run must store it as sharded, versioned, validated records.
- The mathematical object is simple, but the operational contract must survive restarts, parallel workers, schema changes, and audits.
- The notebook for this section uses synthetic data so the same ideas can be executed without external files.

Non-examples:
- A path on disk without a manifest is not a reproducible dataset.
- A metric dashboard without record-level lineage is not a provenance system.
- A filter threshold without an audit sample is not evidence of quality.

Implementation consequence: every transformation should report both a count and a rate.
If $n_{\mathrm{in}}$ records enter the stage and $n_{\mathrm{out}}$ records leave, the
acceptance rate is

$$
a = \frac{n_{\mathrm{out}}}{n_{\mathrm{in}}}.
$$

A sudden change in $a$ is a data-drift signal even when the code still runs. This is why
pipeline math is inseparable from logging, manifests, and audit slices.

For LLM work, the token-weighted view is often more important than the document-weighted
view. A filter that removes 5 percent of documents may remove 30 percent of tokens if it
targets long documents. The corresponding token acceptance rate is

$$
a_{\mathrm{tok}} = \frac{\sum_i f(r_i)\,T_i}{\sum_i T_i},
$$

where $T_i$ is the token count or a deterministic token-count estimate. The distinction
matters for compute budgets, mixture proportions, and scaling-law interpretation.

## 6. Monitoring and Human Audit

Monitoring and Human Audit gives the conceptual and mathematical layer for quality
checks. The local variables in this section should be read as pipeline objects:
documents, records, tokens, filters, weights, shards, and manifests.

### 6.1 Distribution summaries

Distribution summaries is part of the canonical scope of quality checks. We model the
relevant object as a finite collection $\mathcal{D} = \{r_i\}_{i=1}^n$ with record-level
metadata $m_i$ and text or token content $x_i$. The practical question is whether the
transformation preserves the intended empirical distribution.

A useful local invariant is:

$$
\text{valid}(r_i, \mathcal{S}) = 1 \quad \Longrightarrow \quad r_i \text{ can be consumed by the next pipeline stage.}
$$

For `quality score`, the invariant should be explicit enough that a checker can fail
fast. If the invariant is only written in a notebook comment or an engineer's memory, it
will not protect a long-running data build.

Examples:
- A small local experiment can store this object in memory; a frontier-scale run must store it as sharded, versioned, validated records.
- The mathematical object is simple, but the operational contract must survive restarts, parallel workers, schema changes, and audits.
- The notebook for this section uses synthetic data so the same ideas can be executed without external files.

Non-examples:
- A path on disk without a manifest is not a reproducible dataset.
- A metric dashboard without record-level lineage is not a provenance system.
- A filter threshold without an audit sample is not evidence of quality.

Implementation consequence: every transformation should report both a count and a rate.
If $n_{\mathrm{in}}$ records enter the stage and $n_{\mathrm{out}}$ records leave, the
acceptance rate is

$$
a = \frac{n_{\mathrm{out}}}{n_{\mathrm{in}}}.
$$

A sudden change in $a$ is a data-drift signal even when the code still runs. This is why
pipeline math is inseparable from logging, manifests, and audit slices.

For LLM work, the token-weighted view is often more important than the document-weighted
view. A filter that removes 5 percent of documents may remove 30 percent of tokens if it
targets long documents. The corresponding token acceptance rate is

$$
a_{\mathrm{tok}} = \frac{\sum_i f(r_i)\,T_i}{\sum_i T_i},
$$

where $T_i$ is the token count or a deterministic token-count estimate. The distinction
matters for compute budgets, mixture proportions, and scaling-law interpretation.

### 6.2 Sample review rubric

Sample review rubric is part of the canonical scope of quality checks. We model the
relevant object as a finite collection $\mathcal{D} = \{r_i\}_{i=1}^n$ with record-level
metadata $m_i$ and text or token content $x_i$. The practical question is whether the

## 7. Common Mistakes

| # | Mistake | Why It Is Wrong | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Trusting a file because it exists | A zero-byte or unparsable artifact can still pass a loose path check | Validate content and parseability |
| 2 | Counting documents but not tokens | Long documents dominate compute | Report both document and token rates |
| 3 | Changing schemas without versioning | Old and new records become indistinguishable | Pin schema versions in every record |
| 4 | Dropping metadata during transforms | Audits and removals become impossible | Preserve source and transform lineage |
| 5 | Using nondeterministic ordering | Rebuilds cannot be compared | Seed and record ordering rules |
| 6 | Ignoring failed records | Silent loss can bias the corpus | Quarantine and summarize failures |
| 7 | Treating filters as neutral | Filters encode preferences and tradeoffs | Ablate and audit every major filter |
| 8 | Mixing train and eval sources | Evaluation becomes contaminated | Run overlap audits before release |
| 9 | Optimizing one aggregate score | Small domains can regress | Track slice metrics |
| 10 | Skipping data cards | Users cannot judge intended use or risk | Publish structured documentation |
| 11 | Assuming licenses are uniform | Source terms can conflict | Track license at source and record level |
| 12 | Forgetting reproducible manifests | The same name can refer to different data | Use hashes and version pins |

## 9. Why This Matters for AI

| Concept | AI impact |
| --- | --- |
| quality score | Controls what examples, gradients, risks, or audits the model pipeline can represent |
| filter | Controls what examples, gradients, risks, or audits the model pipeline can represent |
| acceptance rate | Controls what examples, gradients, risks, or audits the model pipeline can represent |
| PII | Controls what examples, gradients, risks, or audits the model pipeline can represent |
| toxicity | Controls what examples, gradients, risks, or audits the model pipeline can represent |
| threshold | Controls what examples, gradients, risks, or audits the model pipeline can represent |
| audit | Controls what examples, gradients, risks, or audits the model pipeline can represent |

Data pipeline quality is model quality in delayed form. The model eventually converts these records into gradients; any unresolved ambiguity becomes either wasted compute, misleading evaluation, memorization risk, or irreproducible science.

## 10. Conceptual Bridge

This section connects the previous and next pieces of the curriculum as follows:

```text
raw sources -> records -> validation -> assembly -> audits -> documentation -> mixture
```

The next section is [Full Dataset Assembly](../04-Full-Dataset-Assembly/notes.md). It
uses the contracts established here and moves one step further through the LLM data
pipeline.
