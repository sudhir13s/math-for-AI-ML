# Convolution Theorem

> _"The convolution theorem is the most important theorem in signal processing — it is what makes Fourier analysis a practical computational tool rather than a purely theoretical construct."_
> — Alan V. Oppenheim, MIT EECS

## Overview

The Convolution Theorem establishes one of the most beautiful and practically consequential dualities in all of mathematics: **convolution in the time domain equals pointwise multiplication in the frequency domain**. This single identity reduces an $O(N^2)$ sliding-dot-product computation to $O(N \log N)$ FFT-based arithmetic — a transformation that made real-time digital audio processing possible in the 1970s and powers nearly every modern deep learning architecture today.

This section develops the Convolution Theorem rigorously in both its continuous and discrete forms, builds the surrounding theory of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems and filter design, treats efficient block-convolution algorithms (overlap-add, overlap-save), and traces the theorem's consequences through cross-correlation, the Wiener-Khinchin theorem, and deconvolution. The second half connects these classical results to modern AI: convolutional neural networks as learned frequency filters, WaveNet's causal dilated convolutions, state space models (S4, Mamba) as implicit convolution operators, the Hyena hierarchy's parameterized long convolutions, and FNet's replacement of multi-head attention with a single 2D FFT.

The Convolution Theorem is not merely useful — it is a ring isomorphism. The DFT diagonalizes the circular convolution algebra $\mathbb{C}[\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}]$, turning a non-commutative-looking operation into trivial pointwise multiplication. Understanding *why* this works — through the lens of group representation theory and Fourier analysis on abelian groups — gives deep insight into why spectral methods are so pervasive in modern sequence modeling.

## 1. Intuition

### 1.1 What Is Convolution?

Convolution is a mathematical operation that blends two functions by sliding one over the other and measuring their overlap at each position. More precisely, the **linear convolution** of $f$ and $g$ at position $t$ is the integral of the pointwise product of $f$ with a reversed, shifted copy of $g$:

$$(f * g)(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(\tau)\, g(t - \tau)\, d\tau$$

The operation appears in an enormous variety of contexts, often without being recognized as convolution:

- **Image blurring**: convolving an image with a Gaussian kernel $g(x,y) = e^{-(x^2+y^2)/2\sigma^2}$ produces a smoothed version. Each output pixel is a weighted average of its neighborhood.
- **Running average**: a box filter $g[n] = \frac{1}{M}\mathbf{1}_{[0,M-1]}$ convolved with a time series produces the $M$-point moving average — standard in financial data smoothing.
- **Polynomial multiplication**: multiplying $(a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2)$ by $(b_0 + b_1 x)$ gives coefficients that are exactly the linear convolution of $[a_0, a_1, a_2]$ and $[b_0, b_1]$. This is why the FFT can multiply two degree-$N$ polynomials in $O(N \log N)$ operations.
- **Echo simulation**: convolving an audio signal with a room impulse response $h(t)$ (the sound of a clap in an empty hall) produces the "reverberated" signal.
- **Probability**: the PDF of the sum $Z = X + Y$ of independent random variables is $(p_X * p_Y)(z)$ — convolution of their PDFs.

The defining algebraic property is that convolution is **commutative** ($f * g = g * f$), **associative** ($(f * g) * h = f * (g * h)$), and **distributive** over addition. These properties make it a natural operation in any linear system.

**For AI:** every convolutional layer in a CNN computes exactly this operation. A $3 \times 3$ filter $W$ convolved with feature map $X$ gives $Y = W * X$ — the kernel slides over the input, taking inner products at each position. Understanding convolution as sliding-overlap reveals why translation equivariance holds: if the input shifts, the output shifts by the same amount.

### 1.2 The Central Insight: Frequency Domain Diagonalization

Computing convolution directly costs $O(N^2)$ operations: for each of $N$ output positions, you compute an inner product with $N$ filter coefficients. For $N = 10^6$ samples (one second of audio at 1 MHz), this is $10^{12}$ multiplications — completely infeasible.

The Convolution Theorem provides a dramatic shortcut. The key observation is that **complex exponentials are eigenfunctions of convolution**:

$$(h * e^{2\pi i f \cdot})(t) = \underbrace{\left(\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} h(\tau) e^{-2\pi i f \tau} d\tau\right)}_{\hat{h}(f) = H(f)} \cdot e^{2\pi i f t}$$

Each complex exponential $e^{2\pi i ft}$ passes through any LTI system unchanged in frequency — it is only scaled by the complex number $H(f) = \hat{h}(f)$. This means:
1. **Decompose** the input $x$ into its frequency components via the Fourier transform: $X(f) = \mathcal{F}(x)(f)$
2. **Multiply** each component by the filter's frequency response: $Y(f) = H(f) \cdot X(f)$ (pointwise, $O(N)$)
3. **Reconstruct** the output via the inverse Fourier transform: $y = \mathcal{F}^{-1}(Y)$

Steps 1 and 3 each cost $O(N \log N)$ via the FFT. Step 2 costs $O(N)$. The total is $O(N \log N)$ — compared to $O(N^2)$ for direct convolution.

```
CONVOLUTION THEOREM: TWO EQUIVALENT COMPUTATIONS

                           O(N log N) via FFT

  Both computations give IDENTICAL output y[n].

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

The mathematical reason this works is deep: the DFT is a **ring isomorphism** between $(\mathbb{C}^N, \circledast)$ — the ring of sequences under circular convolution — and $(\mathbb{C}^N, \cdot)$ — the ring of sequences under pointwise multiplication. Convolution, which looks complicated, becomes trivial multiplication after a change of basis.

### 1.3 Why This Matters for AI (First Look)

The Convolution Theorem is not merely a classical signal processing tool — it is at the heart of modern deep learning architectures:

- **CNNs**: every `torch.nn.Conv2d` layer computes a learned 2D convolution. For large kernels, PyTorch uses FFT-based convolution internally. The frequency domain perspective explains why early CNN layers learn Gabor-like filters (oriented bandpass filters) and why deep layers respond to semantic content.
- **WaveNet** (van den Oord et al., 2016): autoregressive waveform generation using dilated causal convolutions. The receptive field grows exponentially with depth via dilation, reaching $2^L - 1$ samples with only $L$ layers.
- **S4** (Gu et al., 2021): represents a sequence model as a linear recurrence $\mathbf{h}_t = A\mathbf{h}_{t-1} + B x_t$, $y_t = C\mathbf{h}_t$. During training, the recurrence is unrolled into a convolution $y = \bar{\mathbf{K}} * x$ where $\bar{\mathbf{K}} = [C\bar{B}, C\bar{A}\bar{B}, C\bar{A}^2\bar{B}, \ldots]$ is the SSM kernel, computed in $O(N \log N)$ via FFT.
- **Hyena** (Poli et al., 2023): replaces attention with $d$ learned long convolutions $h_1, \ldots, h_d$, each parameterized by a neural network. Complexity is $O(N \log N)$ per layer vs. $O(N^2)$ for attention.
- **FNet** (Lee-Thorp et al., 2022): replaces multi-head attention with a single 2D FFT mixing operation, achieving 92% of BERT's GLUE score with 7× speedup.

## 2. Formal Definitions

### 2.1 Linear (Aperiodic) Convolution

**Definition (Continuous Linear Convolution).** For $f, g \in L^1(\mathbb{R})$, the **convolution** of $f$ and $g$ is:

$$(f * g)(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(\tau)\, g(t - \tau)\, d\tau$$

The integral is well-defined a.e. and $f * g \in L^1(\mathbb{R})$ by Young's inequality.

**Definition (Discrete Linear Convolution).** For sequences $x \in \ell^1(\mathbb{Z})$ and $h \in \ell^1(\mathbb{Z})$:

$$(x * h)[n] = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} x[k]\, h[n - k]$$

For finite sequences of lengths $M$ and $N$, the output has length $M + N - 1$.

**Algebraic properties:**
- **Commutativity:** $f * g = g * f$ (proof: substitute $u = t - \tau$)
- **Associativity:** $(f * g) * h = f * (g * h)$ (follows from Fubini's theorem)
- **Distributivity:** $f * (g + h) = f * g + f * h$
- **Identity:** $f * \delta = f$ where $\delta$ is the Dirac delta (continuous) or Kronecker delta (discrete)
- **Scaling:** $(af) * g = a(f * g)$ for $a \in \mathbb{C}$

**Support rule:** If $f$ is supported on $[a_1, a_2]$ and $g$ on $[b_1, b_2]$, then $f * g$ is supported on $[a_1 + b_1, a_2 + b_2]$. For finite sequences of lengths $M$ and $N$, the output has exactly $M + N - 1$ non-zero samples.

**Standard examples:**

*Example 1 (Gaussian ★ Gaussian):* If $f = \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_1^2)$ and $g = \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_2^2)$ (as PDFs), then:
$$(f * g)(t) = \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_1^2 + \sigma_2^2)(t)$$
Convolution of Gaussians is Gaussian with variance sum. This is the sum-of-independent-normals theorem.

*Example 2 (rect ★ rect = triangle):* The convolution of two rectangular pulses $\Pi_{[0,1]}$ is the triangle function $\Lambda$ supported on $[0, 2]$. Each rect ★ rect gives a piecewise-linear tent.

*Example 3 (polynomial multiplication):* $(1 + 2x)(3 + 4x) = 3 + 10x + 8x^2$. As convolution: $[1, 2] * [3, 4] = [3, 10, 8]$.

**Non-examples:**
- $f * g$ is NOT the pointwise product $f \cdot g$ — these are entirely different operations.
- The convolution of two non-integrable functions (e.g., constants) is not generally well-defined in $L^1$.

### 2.2 Circular (Periodic) Convolution

**Definition (Circular Convolution).** For $x, y \in \mathbb{C}^N$, the **$N$-point circular (periodic) convolution** is:

$$(x \circledast y)[n] = \sum_{m=0}^{N-1} x[m]\, y[(n - m) \bmod N], \quad n = 0, 1, \ldots, N-1$$

Circular convolution wraps the index modulo $N$: sample $y[-1]$ is the same as $y[N-1]$.

The **key difference** from linear convolution: circular convolution assumes both signals are periodic with period $N$. When the input is not actually periodic, the wrap-around creates **time-aliasing** — contributions from the "end" of the sequence wrap around and contaminate the "beginning" of the output. This produces incorrect results whenever $y$ is not truly $N$-periodic.

**Matrix form:** Circular convolution is exactly a matrix-vector product with a **circulant matrix**:

$$y = C_h \mathbf{x}, \qquad (C_h)_{ij} = h[(i-j) \bmod N]$$

Every circulant matrix is diagonalized by the DFT matrix $F_N$:
$$C_h = F_N^{-1} \operatorname{diag}(H) F_N, \quad H = F_N \mathbf{h}$$

This is precisely the Convolution Theorem in matrix form.

**When circular = linear:** If $x$ has length $M$ and $h$ has length $L$, zero-pad both to length $N \geq M + L - 1$. Then $N$-point circular convolution equals linear convolution exactly.

### 2.3 Cross-Correlation and Autocorrelation

**Definition (Cross-Correlation).** The **cross-correlation** of $f$ and $g$ is:

$$(f \star g)(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f^*(\tau)\, g(t + \tau)\, d\tau = (f^*(- \cdot) * g)(t)$$

Note: cross-correlation is convolution with the time-reversed conjugate of the first argument. It is **not** commutative: $(f \star g)(t) = (g \star f)^*(-t)$.

Cross-correlation measures the **similarity** between $f$ and a shifted copy of $g$. The peak of $|(f \star g)(t)|$ occurs at the lag $t$ where $g$ most resembles $f$.

**Definition (Autocorrelation).** The autocorrelation of $f$ is:

$$R_{ff}(\tau) = (f \star f)(\tau) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f^*(t)\, f(t + \tau)\, dt$$

Properties:
- $R_{ff}(0) = \lVert f \rVert_2^2$ (maximum at zero lag)
- $R_{ff}(\tau) = R_{ff}^*(-\tau)$ (Hermitian symmetry)
- $|R_{ff}(\tau)| \leq R_{ff}(0)$ for all $\tau$

**For AI:** Cross-correlation is the operation actually computed in standard "convolution" layers in PyTorch and TensorFlow. The `torch.nn.Conv2d` layer computes $(W \star x)$ (cross-correlation), not $(W * x)$ (true convolution). Since the filter weights are learned, this distinction does not affect expressive power — the network simply learns the time-reversed filter.

### 2.4 The Convolution Algebra

The space $L^1(\mathbb{R})$ equipped with convolution is a commutative **Banach algebra**:
- Vector space: $(L^1(\mathbb{R}), +, \cdot)$
- Algebra: equipped with multiplication $(f, g) \mapsto f * g$
- Banach: complete normed space with $\lVert f * g \rVert_1 \leq \lVert f \rVert_1 \lVert g \rVert_1$

The discrete version: $\ell^1(\mathbb{Z})$ with discrete convolution is a Banach algebra under the same submultiplicativity bound.

The **cyclic group algebra** $\mathbb{C}[\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}] \cong \mathbb{C}^N$ with circular convolution is a **commutative semisimple algebra** over $\mathbb{C}$. By Maschke's theorem (since $\operatorname{char}(\mathbb{C}) \nmid N$), it decomposes as:

$$\mathbb{C}[\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}] \cong \bigoplus_{k=0}^{N-1} \mathbb{C} \cdot e_k$$

where $e_k$ are the primitive idempotents — the DFT basis vectors $\omega_N^{kn}$. The DFT is exactly the isomorphism to the direct sum. Convolution in the group algebra becomes pointwise multiplication in the direct sum decomposition — this is the algebraic content of the Convolution Theorem.


## 3. The Convolution Theorem

### 3.1 Continuous Version

**Theorem (Convolution Theorem, Continuous).** Let $f, g \in L^1(\mathbb{R})$. Then $f * g \in L^1(\mathbb{R})$ and:

$$\mathcal{F}(f * g)(\xi) = \hat{f}(\xi) \cdot \hat{g}(\xi)$$

where $\hat{f}(\xi) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t)\, e^{-2\pi i \xi t}\, dt$ (using the $\xi$-convention consistent with §20-02).

**Proof.** Compute directly using Fubini's theorem (justified by $\lVert f * g \rVert_1 \leq \lVert f \rVert_1 \lVert g \rVert_1 < \infty$):

$$\mathcal{F}(f * g)(\xi) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \left[\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(\tau)\, g(t-\tau)\, d\tau \right] e^{-2\pi i \xi t}\, dt$$

Swap integration order and substitute $u = t - \tau$:

$$= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(\tau) \left[\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} g(u)\, e^{-2\pi i \xi (u+\tau)}\, du \right] d\tau = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(\tau)\, e^{-2\pi i \xi \tau}\, d\tau \cdot \hat{g}(\xi) = \hat{f}(\xi) \cdot \hat{g}(\xi) \qquad \square$$

**Extension to $L^2$:** For $f \in L^1 \cap L^2$ and $g \in L^2$, the theorem still holds in $L^2$ by a density argument, with $\lVert f * g \rVert_2 \leq \lVert f \rVert_1 \lVert g \rVert_2$ (a special case of Young's inequality).

**Corollary (Shift Theorem).** If $g_a(t) = g(t - a)$ is a shifted version of $g$:
$$\hat{g}_a(\xi) = e^{-2\pi i a \xi} \hat{g}(\xi)$$
This follows from the Convolution Theorem applied to $g * \delta_a$ where $\hat{\delta}_a(\xi) = e^{-2\pi i a \xi}$.

**For AI:** Dilated convolutions in WaveNet compute $(h * x_{\text{dilated}})[n]$ where $x_{\text{dilated}}[n] = x[n/d]$ for dilation factor $d$. In frequency: $\mathcal{F}(x_{\text{dilated}})(\xi) = |d| \cdot \hat{x}(d\xi)$ — dilation in time becomes compression in frequency. Each dilation level captures different frequency bands.

### 3.2 Discrete Version

**Theorem (Convolution Theorem, Discrete).** For $x, y \in \mathbb{C}^N$ with DFT $X = \mathcal{F}(x)$ and $Y = \mathcal{F}(y)$:

$$\mathcal{F}(x \circledast y)[k] = X[k] \cdot Y[k], \quad k = 0, 1, \ldots, N-1$$

Equivalently: $x \circledast y = \mathcal{F}^{-1}(X \cdot Y)$.

**Proof.** Compute the DFT of the circular convolution directly:

$$\mathcal{F}(x \circledast y)[k] = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \left[\sum_{m=0}^{N-1} x[m]\, y[(n-m) \bmod N]\right] \omega_N^{-nk}$$

where $\omega_N = e^{2\pi i / N}$. Swap sums and substitute $j = (n-m) \bmod N$:

$$= \sum_{m=0}^{N-1} x[m] \omega_N^{-mk} \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} y[j]\, \omega_N^{-jk} = X[k] \cdot Y[k] \qquad \square$$

**Normalization bookkeeping.** NumPy's `np.fft.ifft` divides by $N$, so the full pipeline is:
```
Y_k = X_k * H_k          (pointwise, no 1/N)
y = np.fft.ifft(Y_k)     (divides by N automatically)
```
Avoid double-dividing by $N$ when mixing manual DFT with NumPy functions.

**Algorithm: FFT-based convolution of $x$ (length $M$) with $h$ (length $L$):**
1. Choose $N \geq M + L - 1$, next power of 2: $N = 2^{\lceil \log_2(M+L-1) \rceil}$
2. Zero-pad: $\tilde{x}[n] = x[n]$ for $n < M$, else $0$; similarly $\tilde{h}$
3. $X = \text{FFT}(\tilde{x})$, $H = \text{FFT}(\tilde{h})$
4. $Y[k] = X[k] \cdot H[k]$ for all $k$
5. $y = \text{IFFT}(Y)$, keep first $M + L - 1$ samples

Total cost: $3 \cdot O(N \log N)$ for three FFTs + $O(N)$ for pointwise multiply.

### 3.3 The Multiplication Theorem (Dual)

**Theorem (Multiplication / Dual Convolution Theorem).** For $f, g \in L^1(\mathbb{R}) \cap L^2(\mathbb{R})$:

$$\mathcal{F}(f \cdot g)(\xi) = (\hat{f} * \hat{g})(\xi) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \hat{f}(\eta)\, \hat{g}(\xi - \eta)\, d\eta$$

Pointwise multiplication in time = convolution in frequency. This is exact duality with the Convolution Theorem.

**Consequences:**
- **Windowing:** Multiplying a signal by a window $w(t)$ (e.g., Hann window) convolves its spectrum with $\hat{w}(\xi)$. This is the spectral leakage mechanism studied in §20-03: the wider the window in time, the narrower $\hat{w}$ in frequency, and the less leakage.
- **Amplitude modulation:** $x(t) \cos(2\pi f_0 t) = x(t) \cdot \frac{1}{2}(e^{2\pi i f_0 t} + e^{-2\pi i f_0 t})$ shifts the spectrum to $\pm f_0$. In the frequency domain: $\hat{X}(\xi - f_0)/2 + \hat{X}(\xi + f_0)/2$.
- **Parseval's theorem:** Setting $g = f$ and $\xi = 0$: $\int |f(t)|^2 dt = \int |\hat{f}(\xi)|^2 d\xi$.

### 3.4 Parseval and Convolution

**Parseval's theorem for convolution.** Combining Plancherel and the Convolution Theorem:

$$\lVert f * g \rVert_2^2 = \int |\hat{f}(\xi) \hat{g}(\xi)|^2 d\xi = \lVert \hat{f} \cdot \hat{g} \rVert_2^2$$

**Young's convolution inequality.** For $\frac{1}{r} = \frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} - 1$ with $1 \leq p, q, r \leq \infty$:

$$\lVert f * g \rVert_r \leq \lVert f \rVert_p \lVert g \rVert_q$$

Special cases:
- $p = 1, q = r = 2$: $\lVert f * g \rVert_2 \leq \lVert f \rVert_1 \lVert g \rVert_2$ (used in filter stability analysis)
- $p = q = 1, r = 1$: $\lVert f * g \rVert_1 \leq \lVert f \rVert_1 \lVert g \rVert_1$ (Banach algebra property)
- $p = 1, q = \infty, r = \infty$: $\lVert f * g \rVert_\infty \leq \lVert f \rVert_1 \lVert g \rVert_\infty$

**Energy interpretation:** The energy of the filtered output is bounded by the filter's $L^1$ norm times the input's $L^2$ energy. A filter with $\lVert h \rVert_1 \leq 1$ is **energy non-increasing** — it cannot amplify energy.


## 4. Circular vs. Linear Convolution

### 4.1 The Wrap-Around Problem

Circular convolution assumes periodicity. When you apply the DFT-multiply-IDFT recipe to two finite sequences without zero-padding, you compute *circular* convolution — and the result is *not* the same as linear convolution.

**The wrap-around artifact.** Suppose $x = [1, 2, 3]$ and $h = [1, 1]$ (both length $N = 3$). Linear convolution gives $y_{\text{lin}} = [1, 3, 5, 3]$ (length 4). But the 3-point circular convolution gives:

$$(x \circledast h)[0] = x[0]h[0] + x[2]h[1] = 1 + 3 = 4$$

because the term $x[-1 \bmod 3] = x[2]$ wraps around. The correct linear result would have $y_{\text{lin}}[0] = 1$.

**Time-aliasing analogy.** Circular convolution on a length-$N$ DFT is the time-domain analogue of frequency-domain aliasing. Just as undersampling causes spectral copies to overlap (aliasing in frequency), using an insufficient DFT size causes time-domain copies to overlap (aliasing in time).

```
CIRCULAR vs LINEAR CONVOLUTION
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  x = [1, 2, 3],  h = [1, 1]

  LINEAR (correct):                CIRCULAR (N=3, wrap-around error):
  y[0] = 1·1         = 1          y[0] = 1·1 + 3·1 = 4  ← WRONG
  y[1] = 2·1 + 1·1   = 3          y[1] = 2·1 + 1·1 = 3  ✓
  y[2] = 3·1 + 2·1   = 5          y[2] = 3·1 + 2·1 = 5  ✓
  y[3] =      3·1    = 3          (missing term — aliased into y[0])
  Output length: 4                 Output length: 3

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### 4.2 The Zero-Padding Solution

**Theorem.** Let $x \in \mathbb{C}^M$ and $h \in \mathbb{C}^L$. If we zero-pad both to length $N \geq M + L - 1$ before computing the DFT, then the first $M + L - 1$ samples of the $N$-point IDFT of $X \cdot H$ equal the linear convolution $x *_{\text{lin}} h$.

**Why it works.** The linear convolution output has $M + L - 1$ non-zero samples. Padding to $N \geq M + L - 1$ ensures the circular buffer is large enough that the "wrap-around" tail falls on zero-padded positions — so no aliasing occurs.

**Practical recipe:**
```python
N = 2**int(np.ceil(np.log2(len(x) + len(h) - 1)))  # next power of 2
X = np.fft.rfft(x, n=N)
H = np.fft.rfft(h, n=N)
y = np.fft.irfft(X * H, n=N)[:len(x) + len(h) - 1]  # trim to correct length
```
Using `rfft` (real FFT) halves the computation for real-valued inputs.

**Power-of-2 choice.** Padding to the next power of 2 ensures the Cooley-Tukey FFT uses radix-2 butterflies, maximizing efficiency. For some $N$, mixed-radix FFTs (e.g., $N = 3 \times 5 \times 7$) can be as fast or faster; `scipy.fft` automatically chooses the best FFT size.

### 4.3 Cost Analysis

For convolving a signal of length $M$ with a filter of length $L$:

| Method | Flops | When optimal |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| Direct linear convolution | $O(ML)$ | $L \ll M$ (short filter) |
| FFT-based ($N = M + L - 1$) | $O(N \log N)$ | $L$ comparable to $M$ |
| Overlap-add (blocks of size $B$) | $O(M \log L)$ | $M \gg L$ (long signal, fixed filter) |

**Crossover point.** FFT convolution beats direct when $ML \gtrsim N \log_2 N$, approximately:
$$L \gtrsim \frac{N \log_2 N}{M} \approx \log_2 N \approx 20 \text{ (for } N = 10^6 \text{)}$$

For filters longer than $\sim 20$ taps, FFT-based convolution is almost always faster in practice. For very short filters (e.g., $3 \times 3$ CNN kernels), direct convolution with SIMD instructions often wins due to lower overhead.


## 5. LTI Systems and Filter Theory

### 5.1 Linear Time-Invariant Systems

A system $\mathcal{H}: x \mapsto y$ is **linear** if it satisfies superposition:
$$\mathcal{H}(ax + bz) = a\mathcal{H}(x) + b\mathcal{H}(z) \quad \forall a, b \in \mathbb{C}$$

It is **time-invariant** if a time shift in input produces the same time shift in output:
$$\text{if } y = \mathcal{H}(x), \text{ then } \mathcal{H}(x(\cdot - \tau)) = y(\cdot - \tau) \quad \forall \tau$$

**Characterization theorem:** Every LTI system is completely described by its **impulse response** $h(t) = \mathcal{H}(\delta)(t)$. The output for any input $x$ is:
$$y(t) = (h * x)(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} h(\tau)\, x(t-\tau)\, d\tau$$

**Causality:** $h(t) = 0$ for $t < 0$. A causal system cannot depend on future inputs — essential for real-time processing. The convolution simplifies to $y(t) = \int_0^{\infty} h(\tau) x(t - \tau) d\tau$.

**Stability (BIBO):** An LTI system is bounded-input bounded-output (BIBO) stable if and only if:
$$\lVert h \rVert_1 = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |h(t)|\, dt < \infty$$

This is the $L^1$ condition — exactly the domain in which the Convolution Theorem holds most cleanly.

**For AI:** Recurrent neural networks can be analyzed through the LTI lens. A linear RNN $\mathbf{h}_t = A\mathbf{h}_{t-1} + \mathbf{b} x_t$ has impulse response $h[n] = CA^n B$ for $n \geq 0$. BIBO stability requires $\rho(A) < 1$ (spectral radius). S4 enforces stability by constraining $A$ to have negative-real eigenvalues via the HiPPO initialization.

### 5.2 Frequency Response and Transfer Function

**Definition.** The **frequency response** of an LTI system with impulse response $h$ is:
$$H(f) = \hat{h}(f) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} h(t)\, e^{-2\pi i f t}\, dt$$

This is simply the Fourier transform of the impulse response. The Convolution Theorem then gives:
$$Y(f) = H(f) \cdot X(f)$$

The system applies a **complex gain** $H(f)$ to each frequency component:
- $|H(f)|$ — the **magnitude response** (gain/attenuation at frequency $f$)
- $\angle H(f)$ — the **phase response** (phase shift at frequency $f$)

**Group delay.** The group delay measures how much each frequency band is delayed:
$$\tau_g(f) = -\frac{d}{df} \angle H(f)$$

A system with **constant group delay** $\tau_g(f) = \tau_0$ is said to have **linear phase**: $\angle H(f) = -2\pi f \tau_0$. This means all frequencies are delayed by the same amount $\tau_0$ — no dispersion, no distortion of waveform shape.

**Frequency response examples:**

| Filter type | $H(f)$ | Impulse response $h(t)$ |
|-------------|--------|------------------------|
| Ideal lowpass, cutoff $f_c$ | $\mathbf{1}_{|f| \leq f_c}$ | $2f_c \operatorname{sinc}(2f_c t)$ |
| Ideal highpass | $\mathbf{1}_{|f| > f_c}$ | $\delta(t) - 2f_c \operatorname{sinc}(2f_c t)$ |
| Gaussian smoother | $e^{-\pi^2 f^2 / (2\sigma^2)}$ | $\sigma e^{-\sigma^2 \pi^2 t^2 / 2}$ (Gaussian) |
| Differentiator | $2\pi i f$ | $\delta'(t)$ |
| Hilbert transformer | $-i \operatorname{sgn}(f)$ | $\frac{1}{\pi t}$ (Cauchy principal value) |

**For AI:** The Hilbert transformer shifts all frequency components by 90°, producing the analytic signal $z(t) = x(t) + i\mathcal{H}[x](t)$. This is used in envelope detection for audio and is related to the complex-valued activations in modern SSM architectures.

### 5.3 FIR vs. IIR Filters

**FIR (Finite Impulse Response):** $h[n]$ has only finitely many non-zero terms ($n = 0, 1, \ldots, L-1$). Output is a finite weighted sum: $y[n] = \sum_{k=0}^{L-1} h[k] x[n-k]$.

Advantages:
- **Always BIBO stable** (finite sum, bounded output)
- **Can achieve exact linear phase**: symmetric FIR ($h[n] = h[L-1-n]$) has linear phase
- **Easy to design**: window method, least-squares, Parks-McClellan algorithm

Disadvantages:
- **Long filter needed** for sharp frequency cutoffs (e.g., $L \approx 300$ taps for sharp lowpass)
- **High computational cost** for long filters (mitigated by FFT convolution)

**IIR (Infinite Impulse Response):** $h[n]$ is non-zero for all $n \geq 0$. Described by a rational transfer function:

$$H(z) = \frac{B(z)}{A(z)} = \frac{\sum_{k=0}^{M} b_k z^{-k}}{1 + \sum_{k=1}^{N} a_k z^{-k}}$$

Implemented as a recursive difference equation: $y[n] = \sum_k b_k x[n-k] - \sum_k a_k y[n-k]$.

Advantages:
- **Very compact**: sharp frequency responses achievable with few coefficients (e.g., 5th-order Butterworth)
- **Classic analog designs**: Butterworth (maximally flat), Chebyshev (equiripple), elliptic (optimal)

Disadvantages:
- **Stability not guaranteed**: poles of $H(z)$ must lie inside the unit circle
- **Non-linear phase**: group delay is frequency-dependent, causing waveform dispersion
- **Cannot be parallelized easily**: recursive computation creates data dependencies

**For AI:** CNN layers are FIR filters (finite, feedforward). RNNs and LSTMs implement IIR-like behavior (infinite memory via recurrence). S4/Mamba use IIR-structured kernels but compute them in FIR/parallel mode via FFT convolution during training.

### 5.4 Ideal Filter Prototypes

The four ideal filter types, defined by their frequency response:

| Type | $|H(f)|$ | Application |
|------|----------|-------------|
| Lowpass (LP) | $1$ for $|f| \leq f_c$, $0$ otherwise | Smoothing, anti-aliasing |
| Highpass (HP) | $0$ for $|f| \leq f_c$, $1$ otherwise | Edge detection, noise removal |
| Bandpass (BP) | $1$ for $f_1 \leq |f| \leq f_2$, $0$ otherwise | Channel selection, mel filters |
| Bandstop (BS) | $0$ for $f_1 \leq |f| \leq f_2$, $1$ otherwise | Notch filter (50/60 Hz hum removal) |

All ideal filters have impulse responses that are $\operatorname{sinc}$-like — non-causal (extend to $-\infty$) and non-realizable. Real-world filter design approximates these ideal brick-wall responses.

**Gibbs phenomenon.** Truncating the infinite sinc impulse response creates the Gibbs overshoot: the truncated filter's frequency response overshoots the ideal by $\approx 9\%$ at the cutoff regardless of truncation length. Windowing the sinc (multiplying by Hann or Kaiser window) reduces the Gibbs ripple at the cost of a wider transition band — the same leakage-resolution trade-off from §20-03.


## 6. Efficient Long Convolution

### 6.1 Overlap-Add Algorithm

The overlap-add (OA) algorithm efficiently convolves a long signal $x$ of length $M$ with a short filter $h$ of length $L$ by processing $x$ in blocks.

**Algorithm:**
1. Choose block size $B$ (typically $B = 4L$ or $B = 8L$ for efficiency)
2. Pad $h$ to length $N = B + L - 1$, compute $H = \text{FFT}(h, N)$
3. For each block $m = 0, 1, 2, \ldots$:
   a. Extract $x_m = x[mB : (m+1)B]$ (zero-padded if needed)
   b. Compute $X_m = \text{FFT}(x_m, N)$
   c. Compute $Y_m = \text{IFFT}(X_m \cdot H, N)$ — length $N = B + L - 1$
   d. Add $Y_m$ to the output buffer with overlap: `output[m*B : m*B + N] += Y_m`

The last $L - 1$ samples of each block output overlap with the first $L - 1$ samples of the next — these overlapping tails are summed (the "add" in overlap-add).

**Why it works.** Each block-convolution $Y_m$ contains the correct contribution of block $x_m$ to the full output. The convolution theorem guarantees linearity: summing all contributions gives the correct total output.

**Total cost:** $\lceil M/B \rceil$ FFTs of size $N = B + L - 1$, each costing $O(N \log N)$:
$$\text{Total} = O\!\left(\frac{M}{B} \cdot (B + L) \log(B + L)\right) \approx O(M \log L) \quad \text{when } B \approx L$$

Optimal block size minimizes $\frac{(B+L)\log(B+L)}{B}$, giving $B \approx 2L$ to $8L$.

### 6.2 Overlap-Save Algorithm

Overlap-save (OS) is a computationally equivalent alternative that avoids the explicit addition step by saving (reusing) a portion of each input block.

**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize a buffer of size $N = B + L - 1$ filled with zeros
2. For each new $B$ input samples:
   a. Shift buffer left by $B$: keep the last $L-1$ samples from the previous block
   b. Fill buffer positions $[L-1, N-1]$ with the new $B$ input samples
   c. Compute $X_m = \text{FFT}(\text{buffer}, N)$
   d. $Y_m = \text{IFFT}(X_m \cdot H)$
   e. **Discard** first $L-1$ samples of $Y_m$ (circular contamination), save last $B$ samples

The "save" refers to keeping $L-1$ samples from the previous block in the current buffer. The "discard" step removes the circular wrap-around artifacts at the beginning of each block.

**Comparison:**

| Property | Overlap-Add | Overlap-Save |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Computation per block | Same | Same |
| Memory | $2N$ (input + output buffer) | $N$ (single circular buffer) |
| Implementation complexity | Slightly simpler | Slightly more memory-efficient |
| Real-time streaming | Good | Slightly better |

### 6.3 Block Convolution in Practice

**Choosing block size $B$:**
- Too small ($B \ll L$): FFT overhead dominates; most computation is transform, not convolution
- Too large ($B \gg L$): good efficiency, but large latency ($B$ samples before any output)
- Rule of thumb: $B = 4L$ to $8L$ balances efficiency and latency

**`scipy.signal.fftconvolve` implementation:**
```python
import scipy.signal as signal
y = signal.fftconvolve(x, h, mode='full')    # linear conv, output length M+L-1
y = signal.fftconvolve(x, h, mode='same')    # same length as x (centered)
y = signal.fftconvolve(x, h, mode='valid')   # only fully-overlapping part
```

**`scipy.signal.oaconvolve` for long signals:**
```python
y = signal.oaconvolve(x, h, mode='full')    # uses overlap-add internally
```
This is typically 10-100× faster than `fftconvolve` when $M \gg L$.

**For AI:** The overlap-add structure appears in neural audio synthesis. In WaveNet, the causal dilated convolutions can be viewed as a sequence of overlapping block convolutions, where each block is processed causally. This is why WaveNet inference is slow (sequential) but training is fast (parallel over all positions using FFT convolution).


## 7. Cross-Correlation and Power Spectral Density

### 7.1 Cross-Correlation Theorem

**Theorem (Cross-Correlation Theorem).** For $f, g \in L^2(\mathbb{R})$:
$$\mathcal{F}(f \star g)(\xi) = \hat{f}^*(\xi) \cdot \hat{g}(\xi)$$

where $(f \star g)(\tau) = \int f^*(t) g(t + \tau) dt$ is the cross-correlation.

**Proof.** Write $f \star g = f^*(-\cdot) * g$ (time-reverse and conjugate the first argument). Apply the Convolution Theorem and the time-reversal property $\mathcal{F}(f(-\cdot))(\xi) = \hat{f}(-\xi)$:

$$\mathcal{F}(f \star g)(\xi) = \mathcal{F}(f^*(-\cdot))(\xi) \cdot \hat{g}(\xi) = \hat{f}^*(-(-\xi)) \cdot \hat{g}(\xi) = \hat{f}^*(\xi) \cdot \hat{g}(\xi) \qquad \square$$

**Discrete version.** For sequences $x, y \in \mathbb{C}^N$:
$$(x \star y)[k] = \sum_{n} x^*[n]\, y[n+k]$$
$$\mathcal{F}(x \star y)[k] = X^*[k] \cdot Y[k]$$

In NumPy: `np.fft.ifft(np.conj(X) * Y)` computes cross-correlation via FFT.

**Applications:**
- **Template matching**: $(h \star x)(\tau)$ peaks where $x$ most resembles the template $h$ — used in pattern recognition, face detection, audio fingerprinting (Shazam)
- **Time-delay estimation**: the peak of $|R_{xy}(\tau)|$ estimates the time delay between two sensors
- **Matched filter**: the optimal linear filter for detecting a known signal in white noise is the cross-correlator (see §7.3)

### 7.2 Autocorrelation and Wiener-Khinchin Theorem

**Definition.** The **autocorrelation** of $f$ is $R_{ff}(\tau) = (f \star f)(\tau) = \int f^*(t) f(t+\tau) dt$.

**Theorem (Wiener-Khinchin).** For a wide-sense stationary random process $X(t)$ with autocorrelation $R_{XX}(\tau) = \mathbb{E}[X^*(t)X(t+\tau)]$, the **power spectral density** is its Fourier transform:

$$S_{XX}(f) = \mathcal{F}(R_{XX})(f) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} R_{XX}(\tau)\, e^{-2\pi i f \tau}\, d\tau$$

**Corollary.** The total power equals the integral of the PSD:
$$\mathbb{E}[|X(t)|^2] = R_{XX}(0) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} S_{XX}(f)\, df$$

(By Parseval's theorem applied to the autocorrelation.)

**Spectral factorization.** Since $S_{XX}(f) = |\hat{X}(f)|^2 \geq 0$ is non-negative and real, one can always write $S_{XX}(f) = |L(f)|^2$ for a causal filter $L$ — the **spectral factor**. This is used in Wiener filter design.

**Practical estimation.** The **periodogram** estimates the PSD from $N$ samples:
$$\hat{S}_{XX}(f_k) = \frac{1}{N} |X[k]|^2, \quad X = \text{FFT}(x)$$

The periodogram is an **inconsistent estimator** (variance doesn't decrease with $N$). Welch's method averages periodograms over overlapping windowed segments:
$$\hat{S}_{XX}^{\text{Welch}}(f) = \frac{1}{K} \sum_{m=0}^{K-1} \frac{1}{N} |\text{FFT}(x_m \cdot w)|^2$$

**For AI:** Welch's PSD is used in analyzing neural network weight matrices and gradient noise. The gradient PSD reveals dominant frequency scales of gradient oscillations — key for understanding Adam's moment estimation and learning rate scheduling.

### 7.3 Matched Filtering

**Problem:** Given an observation $y(t) = s(t) + n(t)$ where $s$ is a known signal and $n$ is white noise with spectral density $N_0$, find the linear filter $h$ that maximizes the **output SNR** at detection time $t_0$.

**Theorem (Matched Filter).** The optimal filter is:
$$H_{\text{MF}}(f) = \frac{S^*(f) e^{-2\pi i f t_0}}{N_0}$$

i.e., $h(t) = \frac{1}{N_0} s^*(t_0 - t)$ — the time-reversed, conjugated, delayed signal. The maximum output SNR is:
$$\text{SNR}_{\text{max}} = \frac{2}{N_0} \int |S(f)|^2 df = \frac{2 \lVert s \rVert_2^2}{N_0}$$

The matched filter output is proportional to the cross-correlation of $y$ with $s$.

**For AI:** The attention mechanism in Transformers can be interpreted as a soft matched filter. The query $\mathbf{q}$ plays the role of a template signal; the keys $\mathbf{k}_j$ are candidate matches; $\text{softmax}(\mathbf{q}^\top \mathbf{k}_j / \sqrt{d_k})$ is a soft selection of the best-matching key, analogous to thresholding the cross-correlation peak.


## 8. Deconvolution

### 8.1 The Deconvolution Problem

**Problem setup.** Given the observed signal $y = h * x + n$ where $h$ is a known (or estimated) blurring/mixing filter, $x$ is the unknown clean signal, and $n$ is additive noise, recover $x$.

In the frequency domain: $Y(f) = H(f) X(f) + N(f)$.

**Naive inverse filter.** The obvious approach is $\hat{X}(f) = Y(f) / H(f)$. This recovers $X(f)$ exactly when $n = 0$, but in the presence of noise:
$$\hat{X}(f) = X(f) + \frac{N(f)}{H(f)}$$

When $H(f) \approx 0$ at some frequencies (the filter attenuates them strongly), the noise term $N(f)/H(f)$ is amplified catastrophically. The inverse filter is numerically **ill-conditioned** — a small noise level can produce arbitrarily large artifacts.

**Example (image deblurring):** A Gaussian blur $H(f) = e^{-\pi^2 f^2 / (2\sigma^2)}$ decays to near-zero at high frequencies. Dividing by $H(f)$ at high frequencies amplifies high-frequency noise by factors of $e^{\pi^2 f^2 / (2\sigma^2)}$, producing extreme ringing artifacts.

### 8.2 Wiener Filter

The **Wiener filter** is the optimal linear filter minimizing the mean squared error $\mathbb{E}[|x(t) - \hat{x}(t)|^2]$.

**Theorem (Wiener Filter).** The optimal deconvolution filter in the frequency domain is:
$$H_W(f) = \frac{H^*(f) S_{xx}(f)}{|H(f)|^2 S_{xx}(f) + S_{nn}(f)}$$

where $S_{xx}(f)$ is the PSD of the signal and $S_{nn}(f)$ is the PSD of the noise.

**Derivation sketch.** We seek $G(f)$ such that $\hat{X}(f) = G(f) Y(f) = G(f)(H(f)X(f) + N(f))$ minimizes $\mathbb{E}[|X(f) - \hat{X}(f)|^2]$. Setting the derivative to zero (orthogonality principle):
$$G(f) = \frac{H^*(f) S_{xx}(f)}{|H(f)|^2 S_{xx}(f) + S_{nn}(f)}$$

**Intuition.** The Wiener filter trades off between two regimes:
- When $|H(f)|^2 S_{xx}(f) \gg S_{nn}(f)$ (high SNR): $H_W(f) \approx 1/H(f)$ — nearly perfect inversion
- When $|H(f)|^2 S_{xx}(f) \ll S_{nn}(f)$ (low SNR): $H_W(f) \approx 0$ — suppress the noisy frequency, don't attempt to invert

The ratio $\text{SNR}(f) = S_{xx}(f)|H(f)|^2 / S_{nn}(f)$ governs the transition between inversion and suppression at each frequency.

**For AI:** The Wiener filter principle appears in *noise-robust attention*. Sparse attention patterns (Longformer, BigBird) can be viewed as suppressing "noisy" long-range attention weights when the query-key similarity is low — a form of adaptive filtering where the "SNR" is the attention score.

### 8.3 Regularized Deconvolution

When $S_{xx}$ and $S_{nn}$ are unknown, we use **Tikhonov regularization**:

$$H_{\text{reg}}(f) = \frac{H^*(f)}{|H(f)|^2 + \lambda}$$

The regularization parameter $\lambda > 0$ prevents division by near-zero values of $H(f)$:
- $\lambda \to 0$: approaches inverse filter (unstable)
- $\lambda \to \infty$: output $\hat{x} \to 0$ (over-regularized)
- Optimal $\lambda$ chosen by cross-validation or the **discrepancy principle**

**L-curve method.** Plot $\lVert \hat{x} \rVert_2$ vs. $\lVert y - h * \hat{x} \rVert_2$ as $\lambda$ varies. The "corner" of the L-shaped curve gives a good $\lambda$ — balancing solution norm against residual.

**Sparse deconvolution.** When the clean signal $x$ is sparse (e.g., spike train, musical onset detection), using $L^1$ regularization instead of $L^2$:
$$\hat{x} = \arg\min_x \lVert y - h * x \rVert_2^2 + \lambda \lVert x \rVert_1$$

This is the LASSO in the signal processing context and recovers sparse solutions more faithfully than the Wiener filter, which assumes a smooth Gaussian prior on $x$.


## 9. Applications in Machine Learning

### 9.1 Convolutional Neural Networks

A **convolutional layer** computes cross-correlation (not true convolution, but the distinction is irrelevant since weights are learned):

$$(Y)_{i,j} = \sum_{m,n} W_{m,n} X_{i+m,\, j+n} + b$$

**Frequency perspective:** Each learned filter $W$ is an LTI system with frequency response $\hat{W}(f)$. Deep CNNs learn a hierarchy of filters:
- Layer 1 filters: oriented edges, color gradients (Gabor-like bandpass filters)
- Layer 2 filters: corners, textures (combinations of edge filters)
- Layer $L$ filters: object parts, semantic features

**Dilated convolutions** expand the receptive field without increasing parameters: $(X *_d W)[n] = \sum_k W[k] X[n - dk]$. In frequency: this is equivalent to subsampling $\hat{W}$ by factor $d$, creating copies at multiples of $f_s/d$ — the dilation aliases the filter spectrum.

**1×1 convolutions** are pointwise linear transformations across channels — equivalent to applying a separate MLP at each spatial position. They mix channel information without spatial mixing.

**For AI (2026):** Modern vision transformers (ViT) treat patches as tokens. Recent work shows that early ViT layers perform operations similar to CNN filters — local spatial filtering. Conversely, "ConvNeXt" (Liu et al., 2022) shows that pure CNN architectures can match ViT by adopting transformer-inspired design choices (depth-wise convolutions, GELU activations, layer norm).

### 9.2 Causal Convolution and WaveNet

**WaveNet** (van den Oord et al., 2016) generates raw audio waveforms autoregressively at 16/24 kHz using **dilated causal convolutions**.

**Causal convolution:** $(h *_{\text{causal}} x)[n] = \sum_{k=0}^{L-1} h[k] x[n-k]$ — only past samples contribute. In training, implemented as a padded standard convolution.

**Dilated receptive field:** With dilation factors $d = 1, 2, 4, 8, \ldots, 2^{L-1}$ over $L$ layers, the total receptive field is $2^L - 1$ samples using only $L$ layers of $K$-tap filters. At 16 kHz with $L = 10$ layers of $K = 2$ taps: receptive field = $2^{10} - 1 = 1023$ samples = 64 ms.

### 9.3 State Space Models as Convolution (S4)

The **Structured State Space Sequence model (S4)** (Gu et al., 2021) bridges recurrent and convolutional views of sequence modeling.

**SSM definition.** The continuous-time state space model:
$$\dot{\mathbf{h}}(t) = A\mathbf{h}(t) + B x(t), \quad y(t) = C\mathbf{h}(t) + D x(t)$$

Discretized with step $\Delta$:
$$\mathbf{h}_t = \bar{A}\mathbf{h}_{t-1} + \bar{B} x_t, \quad y_t = C\mathbf{h}_t + D x_t$$
$$\bar{A} = e^{\Delta A}, \quad \bar{B} = (e^{\Delta A} - I)A^{-1}B$$

**Convolutional mode (training).** Unrolling the recurrence gives:
$$y_t = \sum_{k=0}^{t} \underbrace{C \bar{A}^k \bar{B}}_{\bar{K}[k]} x_{t-k} + D x_t$$

The SSM kernel $\bar{\mathbf{K}} = [C\bar{B},\; C\bar{A}\bar{B},\; C\bar{A}^2\bar{B},\; \ldots,\; C\bar{A}^{L-1}\bar{B}]$ defines a length-$L$ FIR filter. Convolution $y = \bar{\mathbf{K}} * x$ is computed in $O(L \log L)$ via FFT.

**HiPPO initialization.** S4 initializes $A$ as the HiPPO matrix that optimally projects history onto Legendre polynomials. This gives $\bar{K}$ long-range decay properties that enable learning dependencies over thousands of steps.

**For AI:** S4 achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Long Range Arena benchmark, processing sequences of length 16,000 in $O(N \log N)$ vs. $O(N^2)$ for Transformers.

### 9.4 Mamba and Selective State Spaces

**Mamba** (Gu & Dao, 2023) extends S4 with **input-selective** SSM parameters: $\bar{A}(x_t), \bar{B}(x_t), C(x_t)$ depend on the input token. This breaks the time-invariance of S4's convolution kernel — the filter $\bar{K}$ is now input-dependent and changes for every sequence.

**Why not use FFT directly:** Since $\bar{K}$ changes with input, Mamba cannot precompute a single convolution kernel and apply it via FFT. Instead, it uses a **hardware-aware parallel scan** algorithm (Blelloch 1990) that processes the recurrence in $O(N)$ time on GPU with memory efficiency via kernel fusion.

**Selective mechanism:** The input-dependent parameters enable the model to selectively "remember" or "forget" context — analogous to LSTM gates but more flexible. This allows Mamba to match or exceed Transformer performance on language modeling while maintaining sub-quadratic scaling.

### 9.5 Hyena and Parameterized Long Convolutions

**Hyena** (Poli et al., 2023) replaces the attention mechanism with a hierarchy of **parameterized long convolutions**.

**Architecture.** A Hyena operator of order $N$ computes:
$$y = h_N * (v_N \odot (h_{N-1} * (v_{N-1} \odot (\cdots (h_1 * (v_1 \odot x)) \cdots))))$$

where each $h_i$ is a learned long convolution (length $= $ sequence length), $v_i = W_i x$ are linear projections, and $\odot$ is elementwise multiplication.

**Parameterization of $h_i$:** Each long filter is parameterized by a small neural network $h_i(t) = f_{\theta}(t)$ evaluated at integer time positions $t = 0, 1, \ldots, L-1$. This gives $O(1)$ parameters per filter regardless of sequence length.

**Complexity:** Each convolution costs $O(N \log N)$ via FFT. Total: $O(dN \log N)$ per layer for order-$d$ Hyena vs. $O(N^2 d)$ for attention.

**For AI:** Hyena reaches 99.9% of attention's performance on CIFAR-10 at sequence length 1024 while being 8× faster. It scales better to length 64K where attention becomes prohibitive.

### 9.6 FNet: Replacing Attention with FFT

**FNet** (Lee-Thorp et al., 2022) replaces the self-attention sub-layer in a standard Transformer with a **2D FFT mixing** layer:

$$\text{FNetMix}(X) = \text{Re}(\mathcal{F}_{\text{seq}}(\mathcal{F}_{\text{model}}(X)))$$

Two FFTs: one along the sequence dimension, one along the model dimension. No learned parameters in the mixing layer — just a fixed unitary transformation. The FFN sub-layers remain unchanged.

**Results:**
- Achieves 92-97% of BERT's performance on GLUE
- Training speed: 7× faster than BERT on TPUs (no attention computation)
- Parameter count: same as BERT (all parameters are in FFN, embeddings, output projection)

**Why it works:** The 2D FFT performs a *global* mixing of all positions and all channels simultaneously. It acts like an "equal attention" that attends to all positions — less expressive than learned attention but sufficient for many tasks after fine-tuning.

**For AI (2026):** FNet is the existence proof that token mixing does not require learned attention. This insight motivated Mlp-Mixer, gMLP, and other mixing architectures that replace $O(N^2)$ attention with $O(N)$ or $O(N \log N)$ alternatives.

### 9.7 Filter Banks Preview

> **Preview: Wavelets and Filter Banks**
>
> The Convolution Theorem underlies an even richer structure: **filter banks** — collections of bandpass filters that partition the spectrum. Convolving a signal with a bank of bandpass filters and subsampling the outputs gives a multi-resolution representation. The **perfect reconstruction** condition requires that the synthesis filters exactly invert the analysis filters — a constraint directly expressed via the Convolution Theorem.
>
> The Haar wavelet is the simplest perfect-reconstruction filter bank: a lowpass filter $h_0 = [1, 1]/\sqrt{2}$ and highpass $h_1 = [1, -1]/\sqrt{2}$. Iterating the lowpass branch produces the discrete wavelet transform (DWT).

## 10. Advanced Topics

### 10.1 Convolution on Groups

The Convolution Theorem extends far beyond $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$ to **any locally compact abelian group** $G$:

$$(f * g)(x) = \int_G f(y^{-1} x)\, g(y)\, d\mu(y)$$

where $\mu$ is the Haar measure on $G$. The Fourier transform on $G$ diagonalizes this convolution exactly as in the classical case:
$$\widehat{f * g}(\chi) = \hat{f}(\chi) \cdot \hat{g}(\chi)$$

where $\chi: G \to \mathbb{T}$ are the **characters** (1D unitary representations) of $G$.

**Examples:**
- $G = \mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$: DFT, circular convolution
- $G = \mathbb{Z}$: Z-transform, discrete convolution
- $G = \mathbb{R}$: Fourier transform, linear convolution
- $G = \mathbb{T}$ (circle): Fourier series, periodic convolution
- $G = \mathbb{R}^n$: multidimensional FT, image processing

**Non-abelian groups.** For non-abelian $G$ (e.g., rotation group $SO(3)$, permutation group $S_n$), the Fourier transform takes values in matrix-valued representations, not scalars. Convolution in the group algebra is still diagonalized, but now each "frequency component" is a matrix equation $\hat{f}(\rho) \cdot \hat{g}(\rho) = \widehat{f * g}(\rho)$ where $\rho$ is an irreducible representation.

**$G$-CNNs** (Cohen & Welling, 2016): Convolutional networks on Lie groups $G$ that are equivariant to all group transformations. Each layer computes group convolution $(f *_G h)(g) = \int_G f(h) W(g^{-1}h)\, dh$. The output transforms predictably under $G$-transformations, encoding equivariance as an inductive bias rather than learning it from data.

**For AI:** Group-equivariant CNNs are used in molecular property prediction ($G = SO(3)$ for 3D rotational equivariance), protein structure prediction (SE(3)-equivariant networks in AlphaFold 2), and medical imaging (rotation/reflection equivariance for tissue classification).

### 10.2 Spectral Graph Convolution

On a graph $\mathcal{G} = (\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E})$ with $N$ nodes, the graph Laplacian $L = D - A$ (where $D$ is the degree matrix) plays the role of the Laplacian in continuous Fourier analysis. Its eigendecomposition $L = U\Lambda U^\top$ defines the **graph Fourier transform**:
$$\hat{\mathbf{x}} = U^\top \mathbf{x}, \quad \mathbf{x} = U\hat{\mathbf{x}}$$

**Graph convolution:**
$$\mathbf{x} *_{\mathcal{G}} \mathbf{h} = U(U^\top \mathbf{x} \odot U^\top \mathbf{h}) = U\operatorname{diag}(\hat{h}) U^\top \mathbf{x}$$

This is the Convolution Theorem on graphs: spectral multiplication = graph convolution.

**Limitations:** Computing $U$ costs $O(N^3)$; the resulting filters are non-localized. ChebNet (Defferrard et al., 2016) approximates $\hat{h}(\Lambda)$ by a Chebyshev polynomial, giving $K$-hop local filters. GCN (Kipf & Welling, 2017) uses the first-order approximation $\hat{h}(\Lambda) \approx \hat{h}_0 I + \hat{h}_1 \tilde{\Lambda}$ (two-parameter filter).

### 10.3 Young's Convolution Inequality

**Theorem (Young's Inequality for Convolutions).** Let $1 \leq p, q, r \leq \infty$ with $\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = 1 + \frac{1}{r}$. For $f \in L^p(\mathbb{R})$ and $g \in L^q(\mathbb{R})$:
$$\lVert f * g \rVert_r \leq \lVert f \rVert_p \lVert g \rVert_q$$

**Key special cases:**

| $p$ | $q$ | $r$ | Interpretation |
|-----|-----|-----|---------------|
| 1 | 1 | 1 | $L^1$ is a Banach algebra under convolution |
| 1 | 2 | 2 | FIR filtering preserves $L^2$ norm (up to $\lVert h \rVert_1$) |
| 1 | $\infty$ | $\infty$ | Bounded signals remain bounded after $L^1$ filtering |
| 2 | 2 | $\infty$ | Autocorrelation is bounded |

**Proof sketch.** Generalized Holder's inequality applied to the convolution integral; see Lieb & Loss "Analysis" §4.2.

**Sharp version (Beckner-Brascamp-Lieb).** The sharp constant in Young's inequality is:
$$\lVert f * g \rVert_r \leq C_{p,q} \lVert f \rVert_p \lVert g \rVert_q, \quad C_{p,q} = \prod_s \left(\frac{p_s^{1/p_s}}{p_s'^{1/p_s'}}\right)^{1/2}$$

Gaussians are the extremizers — they saturate the inequality with equality.


## 11. Common Mistakes

| # | Mistake | Why It's Wrong | Fix |
|---|---------|----------------|-----|
| 1 | Using circular convolution when linear convolution is needed | DFT assumes periodicity; wrap-around artifacts contaminate the output | Zero-pad both sequences to length $\geq M + L - 1$ before DFT |
| 2 | Forgetting to zero-pad to a power of 2 | Non-power-of-2 FFT sizes use slower mixed-radix algorithms | Use `N = 2**ceil(log2(M+L-1))` or let `scipy.fft` choose `N` |
| 3 | Double-dividing by $N$ | Manually computing $\frac{1}{N}\sum x[n]\omega^{nk}$ then calling `np.fft.ifft` (which already divides by $N$) | Use either all-manual or all-NumPy; never mix conventions |
| 4 | Confusing convolution with cross-correlation | `torch.nn.Conv2d` computes cross-correlation $(W \star x)$, not $(W * x)$; for symmetric kernels they are equal, but in general they differ | Cross-correlation flips one input; for learned filters it makes no difference (the network learns the flip) |
| 5 | Ignoring phase response | Analyzing only $|H(f)|$ while ignoring $\angle H(f)$ — phase distortion causes waveform dispersion even if the magnitude response is correct | Always check group delay $\tau_g(f) = -d\angle H/df$; use linear-phase FIR if constant delay is required |
| 6 | Applying IIR filters in both directions without understanding "zero-phase" | `scipy.signal.filtfilt` applies a filter twice (forward then backward) to achieve zero phase, but it is non-causal; cannot be used in real-time streaming | Use `filtfilt` only for offline analysis; use `lfilter` with delay compensation for real-time |
| 7 | Using periodogram directly as PSD estimate | The periodogram has variance equal to its mean (inconsistent estimator) — averaging periodograms over many realizations does not reduce variance | Use Welch's method (`scipy.signal.welch`) to average windowed periodogram estimates |
| 8 | Naive inverse filter on attenuated frequencies | Dividing by $H(f) \approx 0$ amplifies noise by $1/|H(f)|$, which diverges | Use Wiener filter $H_W = H^* S_{xx}/(|H|^2 S_{xx} + S_{nn})$ or regularized inverse $H_W = H^*/(|H|^2 + \lambda)$ |
| 9 | Confusing convolution with element-wise multiplication | Writing `y = h * x` in Python (NumPy) gives element-wise multiply, not convolution | Use `np.convolve(x, h)` or `scipy.signal.fftconvolve(x, h)` for convolution |
| 10 | Incorrect output length after convolution | Not accounting for the "full", "same", or "valid" output modes, or expecting circular convolution to give $M + L - 1$ output samples (it gives $N$) | Know the output lengths: full = $M+L-1$; same = $\max(M,L)$; valid = $|M-L|+1$ |

## 14. Conceptual Bridge

### Looking Back

This section builds directly on three prior foundations. From **§20-01 (Fourier Series)**, we inherit the idea that periodic signals decompose into sinusoidal harmonics and that these harmonics are orthogonal — the very orthogonality that makes the DFT a unitary transform. From **§20-02 (Fourier Transform)**, we carry forward the continuous convolution theorem, Plancherel's theorem, and the $L^1$/$L^2$ framework in which these operations are well-defined. From **§20-03 (DFT and FFT)**, we take the computational machinery: the DFT matrix, the Cooley-Tukey algorithm, and the concept of circular periodicity that makes the discrete Convolution Theorem exact rather than approximate.

The Convolution Theorem can be seen as the *payoff* of all the Fourier analysis developed in §01-03: the abstract orthogonal decomposition becomes a practical speedup. The key insight — that eigenfunctions of convolution are complex exponentials — was already visible in §01's Fourier series (eigenfunctions of translation operators on the circle) and §02's FT (eigenfunctions of all LTI operators). Here we make that insight computationally concrete.

### The Core Equation

$$x \circledast y \;\overset{\mathcal{F}}{\longleftrightarrow}\; X[k] \cdot Y[k]$$

This identity, proved in §3.2, is what connects abstract Fourier analysis to practical engineering and modern deep learning. Every CNN layer, every S4/Mamba layer, every FNet mixer, and every overlap-add audio system computes a consequence of this equation.

### Looking Forward

The **immediate next step** is §20-05 (Wavelets), which uses the Convolution Theorem as its foundation. Wavelet analysis overcomes Fourier's fundamental limitation — no time localization — by using *short* convolutions with oscillatory kernels at multiple scales. The perfect reconstruction filter bank condition (the core technical requirement of wavelets) is a system of equations on the Fourier transforms of the analysis and synthesis filters. Every MRA, DWT, and lifting scheme is a cleverly designed set of convolutions satisfying this spectral condition.

Looking further, this section connects to:
- **§11-04 (Spectral Graph Theory):** Graph convolution = signal processing on irregular domains; ChebNet, GCN, and spectral clustering all use the graph Laplacian eigendecomposition in the same way the Convolution Theorem uses DFT eigenvectors
- **§12-02 (Hilbert Spaces):** The Convolution Theorem in $L^2$ is a statement about isometric isomorphisms of Hilbert spaces; Plancherel's theorem is the isometry; the Convolution Theorem is a multiplicative structure on top
- **§17 (Generative Models):** Diffusion models can be interpreted as iterative deconvolution — the forward process convolves with progressively wider Gaussians, and the reverse process learns the Wiener deconvolution at each noise level

## Appendix A: The Z-Transform and Discrete-Time LTI Systems

The **Z-transform** is the discrete-time counterpart of the Laplace transform, and its restriction to the unit circle is the DTFT (discrete-time Fourier transform):

$$X(z) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x[n]\, z^{-n}, \quad z \in \mathbb{C}$$

The DFT evaluates the Z-transform at $N$ equally spaced points on the unit circle: $z = e^{2\pi i k/N}$ for $k = 0, \ldots, N-1$.

**Convolution in the Z-domain.** The Z-transform of the convolution is the product of Z-transforms:
$$\mathcal{Z}(x * h)(z) = X(z) \cdot H(z)$$

This follows by exactly the same calculation as the continuous Convolution Theorem (substitute $u = n - m$).

**Transfer function.** For an IIR filter with difference equation:
$$y[n] = \sum_{k=0}^{M} b_k x[n-k] - \sum_{k=1}^{N} a_k y[n-k]$$

The Z-transform gives: $Y(z)(1 + \sum a_k z^{-k}) = X(z) \sum b_k z^{-k}$, so:
$$H(z) = \frac{Y(z)}{X(z)} = \frac{\sum_{k=0}^{M} b_k z^{-k}}{1 + \sum_{k=1}^{N} a_k z^{-k}} = \frac{B(z)}{A(z)}$$

**Stability from Z-domain.** The BIBO stability condition $\lVert h \rVert_1 < \infty$ translates to: all poles of $H(z)$ (roots of $A(z)$) must lie strictly inside the unit circle $|z| < 1$.

**Frequency response from transfer function.** Evaluate $H(z)$ on the unit circle: $H(e^{2\pi i f}) = H(z)|_{z = e^{2\pi if}}$. This gives the frequency response directly from the pole-zero plot.

### A.1 Pole-Zero Analysis

The transfer function $H(z) = K \prod_k (z - z_k) / \prod_j (z - p_j)$ has:
- **Zeros** $z_k$: frequencies where $|H(e^{i\omega})| = 0$ (nulled by filter)
- **Poles** $p_j$: resonances where $|H(e^{i\omega})|$ peaks (amplified by filter)

**Notch filter example.** To null frequency $f_0$, place a zero pair at $z = e^{\pm 2\pi i f_0}$:
$$H(z) = (z - e^{2\pi i f_0})(z - e^{-2\pi i f_0}) = z^2 - 2\cos(2\pi f_0)z + 1$$

This creates a perfect null at $f_0$. Used in power-line interference removal (50/60 Hz notch filter).

**For AI:** The poles of a linear RNN $A$ are the Z-transform poles of its impulse response. Stable initialization requires all eigenvalues of $A$ inside the unit disk. S4's HiPPO matrix has eigenvalues on the imaginary axis (continuous time), which after discretization map to eigenvalues near but inside the unit circle — ensuring stability while preserving long-range information.

## Appendix B: Worked Examples

### B.1 Convolution Theorem for the Heat Equation

The heat equation $\partial_t u = \partial_{xx} u$ with initial condition $u(x, 0) = u_0(x)$ is solved by convolution with the heat kernel:

$$u(x, t) = (G_t * u_0)(x), \quad G_t(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{4\pi t}} e^{-x^2/(4t)}$$

**Derivation via Fourier transform.** Take the FT in $x$:
$$\partial_t \hat{u}(\xi, t) = -(2\pi\xi)^2 \hat{u}(\xi, t)$$

This is a simple ODE in $t$: $\hat{u}(\xi, t) = \hat{u}_0(\xi) e^{-(2\pi\xi)^2 t}$.

The Convolution Theorem identifies $e^{-(2\pi\xi)^2 t} = \hat{G}_t(\xi)$ (the FT of the Gaussian kernel $G_t$). Inverting:
$$u(x, t) = \mathcal{F}^{-1}(\hat{G}_t \cdot \hat{u}_0)(x) = (G_t * u_0)(x) \qquad \square$$

The Fourier transform diagonalizes the heat operator: each frequency evolves independently, decaying at rate $(2\pi\xi)^2$. High frequencies decay fastest — blurring sharp features. This is exactly why Gaussian convolution produces smooth outputs.

### B.2 Verification of Circular vs. Linear Convolution

Let $x = [3, 1, 4, 1]$ (length 4) and $h = [1, 2]$ (length 2).

**Linear convolution** (length $4 + 2 - 1 = 5$):
- $y[0] = 3 \cdot 1 = 3$
- $y[1] = 1 \cdot 1 + 3 \cdot 2 = 7$
- $y[2] = 4 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 2 = 6$
- $y[3] = 1 \cdot 1 + 4 \cdot 2 = 9$
- $y[4] = 1 \cdot 2 = 2$
- $y_{\text{lin}} = [3, 7, 6, 9, 2]$

**4-point circular convolution** (wrong — wrap-around):
- $y[0] = 3 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 2 = 5$ ← includes $x[3] \cdot h[1]$, wrong
- $y[1] = 1 \cdot 1 + 3 \cdot 2 = 7$ ✓
- $y[2] = 4 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 2 = 6$ ✓
- $y[3] = 1 \cdot 1 + 4 \cdot 2 = 9$ ✓
- $y_{\text{circ,4}} = [5, 7, 6, 9]$ — first sample is wrong

**8-point circular convolution** (zero-padded, correct):
- Zero-pad $x \to [3,1,4,1,0,0,0,0]$ and $h \to [1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]$
- Circular convolution of length-8 vectors gives $[3,7,6,9,2,0,0,0]$
- Trim to length 5: $[3, 7, 6, 9, 2]$ ✓ matches linear convolution

### B.3 Wiener Filter Derivation in Detail

**Setup.** Observation model: $Y(f) = H(f)X(f) + N(f)$. Desired: estimate $\hat{X}(f) = G(f)Y(f)$ minimizing $\mathbb{E}[|X(f) - G(f)Y(f)|^2]$.

**Expansion:**
$$\mathbb{E}[|X - GY|^2] = \mathbb{E}[|X|^2] - G\mathbb{E}[XY^*] - G^*\mathbb{E}[X^*Y] + |G|^2\mathbb{E}[|Y|^2]$$

Assuming $X$ and $N$ are uncorrelated ($\mathbb{E}[X N^*] = 0$):
- $\mathbb{E}[XY^*] = H^* S_{XX}$
- $\mathbb{E}[|Y|^2] = |H|^2 S_{XX} + S_{NN}$

Setting $\partial/\partial G^* = 0$:
$$G_{\text{opt}} = \frac{H^* S_{XX}}{|H|^2 S_{XX} + S_{NN}}$$

This is the Wiener filter. The minimum MSE at frequency $f$ is:
$$\text{MMSE}(f) = \frac{S_{XX}(f) \cdot S_{NN}(f)}{|H(f)|^2 S_{XX}(f) + S_{NN}(f)} = \frac{S_{XX}(f)}{1 + \text{SNR}(f)}$$

where $\text{SNR}(f) = |H(f)|^2 S_{XX}(f) / S_{NN}(f)$.

## Appendix C: Numerical Notes and Implementation Details

### C.1 Choosing FFT Library

| Library | Speed | Features | Best for |
|---------|-------|----------|----------|
| `numpy.fft` | Good | Basic FFT, rfft | Simple use; numpy-native |
| `scipy.fft` | Better | Handles non-power-of-2 optimally, workers param | General purpose |
| `pyfftw` | Best | Multithreaded FFTW backend | Production speed-critical |
| `torch.fft` | GPU | Batched FFT on GPU | Neural network layers |
| `cuFFT` (via cupy) | GPU | CUDA-native | Large batch processing |

**Rule:** For ML training, use `torch.fft.rfft` which batches over the first dimensions automatically. For signal processing, use `scipy.fft` which automatically selects the best algorithm.

### C.2 Real-Valued Convolution with `rfft`

For real inputs $x$ and $h$, the DFT has conjugate symmetry: $X[N-k] = X[k]^*$. Only the first $N/2 + 1$ values are independent. Using `numpy.fft.rfft` instead of `fft`:
- Input: real $x$ of length $N$
- Output: complex of length $N/2 + 1$ (not $N$)
- Speedup: $\approx 2 \times$ for large $N$

```python
# Real-valued FFT convolution
N = 2**int(np.ceil(np.log2(len(x) + len(h) - 1)))
X = np.fft.rfft(x, n=N)   # length N//2 + 1
H = np.fft.rfft(h, n=N)
y = np.fft.irfft(X * H, n=N)[:len(x) + len(h) - 1]
```

### C.3 Numerical Precision in Convolution

**Round-off error.** FFT-based convolution introduces floating-point errors of order $O(\varepsilon_{\text{mach}} N \log N)$ where $\varepsilon_{\text{mach}} \approx 2.2 \times 10^{-16}$ for double precision. For $N = 2^{20}$: error $\approx 2.2 \times 10^{-16} \times 20 \times 10^6 \approx 4 \times 10^{-9}$ — acceptable for most applications.

**Exact convolution.** For integer-valued signals, the NTT (Number Theoretic Transform over $\mathbb{Z}_p$) computes exact convolution without floating-point error — covered in §20-03.

### C.4 Memory Layout for Batched Convolution

When processing batches of signals in PyTorch:
```python
# Batch of B signals of length L, C channels
x = torch.randn(B, C, L)
X = torch.fft.rfft(x, n=N, dim=-1)    # shape: (B, C, N//2+1)
H = torch.fft.rfft(h.unsqueeze(0), n=N, dim=-1)  # broadcast over batch
Y = X * H
y = torch.fft.irfft(Y, n=N, dim=-1)[:, :, :L]
```

The `dim=-1` argument applies the FFT along the last (time) dimension, leaving batch and channel dimensions intact.

## Appendix D: Connections to Other Chapters

### D.1 Convolution and Probability

The sum $Z = X + Y$ of independent random variables satisfies $p_Z = p_X * p_Y$ (PDF convolution). This connection explains:

- **Central Limit Theorem via FT:** Under mild conditions, $\hat{p}_Z(f) = \hat{p}_X(f) \cdot \hat{p}_Y(f) \to e^{-2\pi^2\sigma^2 f^2}$ (Gaussian in freq), so $p_Z \to \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$ as more terms are added.
- **Characteristic functions:** The characteristic function $\phi_X(t) = \mathbb{E}[e^{itX}]$ is the FT of $p_X$. The convolution theorem gives $\phi_{X+Y} = \phi_X \cdot \phi_Y$ directly.
- **Diffusion models:** The forward diffusion process adds Gaussian noise iteratively. The noisy marginal $q(x_t) = \int q(x_t \mid x_0) q(x_0) dx_0$ is a convolution of the data distribution with a Gaussian kernel.

### D.2 Convolution and Regularization

Ridge regression solves $\min_x \lVert Ax - b \rVert_2^2 + \lambda \lVert x \rVert_2^2$. When $A$ is a circulant matrix (i.e., $A = C_h$ for some filter $h$), ridge regression becomes Tikhonov deconvolution:
$$\hat{X}(f) = \frac{H^*(f)}{|H(f)|^2 + \lambda} Y(f)$$

The regularization parameter $\lambda$ has the same role as in the Wiener filter: it prevents noise amplification at frequencies where $H(f) \approx 0$.

### D.3 Convolution and Kernel Methods

A shift-invariant kernel $k(x - y)$ defines a feature map $\phi: x \mapsto k(x, \cdot)$ such that $k(x, y) = \langle \phi(x), \phi(y) \rangle$. By Bochner's theorem, $k$ is a positive definite shift-invariant kernel if and only if $\hat{k}(\omega) \geq 0$ for all $\omega$ — i.e., $k$ is the FT of a non-negative measure.

**Random Fourier Features** (Rahimi & Recht, 2007): approximate a shift-invariant kernel via Monte Carlo:
$$k(x - y) = \mathbb{E}_{\omega \sim \hat{k}}[e^{i\omega^\top(x-y)}] \approx \frac{1}{D}\sum_{j=1}^D e^{i\omega_j^\top x} (e^{i\omega_j^\top y})^*$$

This approximates the kernel evaluation as a dot product of random Fourier features, reducing kernel SVM training from $O(n^3)$ to $O(nD)$.


## Appendix E: Filter Design Methods

### E.1 Window Method for FIR Design

The **window method** designs a length-$L$ FIR filter approximating an ideal frequency response $H_d(f)$:

1. Compute the ideal (infinite-length) impulse response: $h_d[n] = \int H_d(f) e^{2\pi i fn} df$
2. Truncate to $L$ taps: $h_w[n] = h_d[n] \cdot w[n]$ for $n = 0, \ldots, L-1$

The window $w[n]$ controls the trade-off between transition width and stopband attenuation. Using Hann window gives $-44$ dB stopband; Kaiser window allows continuous tuning via parameter $\beta$:
- $\beta = 0$: rectangular ($-13$ dB)
- $\beta = 5.653$: Hann-equivalent ($-44$ dB)
- $\beta = 8.6$: $-69$ dB stopband

**Kaiser window formulas:**
$$w[n] = \frac{I_0(\beta\sqrt{1-(2n/L-1)^2})}{I_0(\beta)}, \quad \beta = \begin{cases} 0.1102(\alpha-8.7) & \alpha > 50 \\ 0.5842(\alpha-21)^{0.4} + 0.07886(\alpha-21) & 21 \leq \alpha \leq 50 \\ 0 & \alpha < 21 \end{cases}$$

where $\alpha$ is the desired stopband attenuation in dB and $I_0$ is the modified Bessel function.

**Minimum filter length** for Kaiser design with stopband attenuation $\alpha$ dB and transition width $\Delta f$:
$$L \approx \frac{\alpha - 8}{2.285 \cdot 2\pi \Delta f}$$

### E.2 Parks-McClellan (Equiripple) FIR Design

The Parks-McClellan algorithm finds the optimal equiripple FIR filter minimizing the maximum deviation from the desired response. It uses the Remez exchange algorithm on the Chebyshev equiripple approximation problem.

**Key property:** For a given filter length $L$, Parks-McClellan achieves the **minimum transition bandwidth** subject to equal ripple in passband and stopband. The Chebyshev equiripple solution is optimal in the $L^\infty$ sense (minimax).

In Python: `scipy.signal.remez(L, bands, desired, weight)`.

### E.3 Butterworth IIR Design

The **$N$-th order Butterworth filter** maximally flat in the passband:
$$|H(j\Omega)|^2 = \frac{1}{1 + (\Omega/\Omega_c)^{2N}}$$

- $N = 1$: simple RC circuit (6 dB/octave rolloff)
- $N = 2$: 12 dB/octave
- $N$ large: approaches ideal brick-wall

Poles lie on a circle of radius $\Omega_c$ in the left half-plane, equally spaced by $\pi/N$:
$$p_k = \Omega_c e^{i\pi(2k+N-1)/(2N)}, \quad k = 1, \ldots, N$$

In Python: `scipy.signal.butter(N, Wn, btype='low', analog=False)`.

**Trade-off:** Butterworth has no passband ripple but slower rolloff than Chebyshev or elliptic. For applications where in-band flatness is critical (audio, instrumentation), Butterworth is preferred.

## Appendix F: Multidimensional Convolution

### F.1 2D Convolution

For 2D signals (images), the **2D linear convolution** is:
$$(f * g)(x, y) = \int\!\!\int f(u, v)\, g(x-u, y-v)\, du\, dv$$

The **2D Convolution Theorem:**
$$\mathcal{F}_{2D}(f * g)(\xi, \eta) = \hat{f}(\xi, \eta) \cdot \hat{g}(\xi, \eta)$$

where $\hat{f}(\xi, \eta) = \int\!\!\int f(x,y) e^{-2\pi i(\xi x + \eta y)} dx\, dy$.

**Separable filters.** A 2D filter $h(x, y) = h_1(x) h_2(y)$ is **separable** — its 2D FT factors as $\hat{h}(\xi, \eta) = \hat{h}_1(\xi) \hat{h}_2(\eta)$. Separable filtering can be implemented as two sequential 1D convolutions:
$$(h * f)(x, y) = (h_1 *_x (h_2 *_y f))(x, y)$$

Cost: $O(N^2(K_1 + K_2))$ vs $O(N^2 K_1 K_2)$ for non-separable. **Depthwise separable convolutions** in MobileNet exploit this: apply a 1D filter per channel, then mix channels — reducing parameters by a factor of $K^2$ for a $K \times K$ filter.

### F.2 Image Processing Applications

Common 2D convolution kernels and their frequency responses:

| Kernel | FT behavior | Effect |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Gaussian $G_\sigma$ | Gaussian $e^{-2\pi^2\sigma^2(\xi^2+\eta^2)}$ | Lowpass, smooth |
| Laplacian $\nabla^2$ | $-4\pi^2(\xi^2 + \eta^2)$ | Highpass, edge enhance |
| Sobel x-direction | $2\pi i \xi \cdot \text{window}$ | Horizontal gradient |
| Box filter $\frac{1}{K^2}\mathbf{1}_{K\times K}$ | $\operatorname{sinc}(K\xi)\operatorname{sinc}(K\eta)$ | Lowpass, boxy |
| Identity | $1$ everywhere | No change |

**Unsharp masking:** $f_{\text{sharp}} = f + \alpha(f - G_\sigma * f) = (1 + \alpha)f - \alpha G_\sigma * f$. In frequency: $H(\xi) = 1 + \alpha(1 - e^{-2\pi^2\sigma^2|\xi|^2})$ — boosts high frequencies.

## Appendix G: Convolution in Sequence Modeling Timeline

The evolution of convolution in deep learning sequence modeling:

| Year | Model | Convolution Type | Key Innovation |
|------|-------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1989 | LeNet | 2D spatial conv | Translation equivariance for images |
| 1997 | LSTM | Gated recurrence | Implicitly learns long-range IIR response |
| 2016 | WaveNet | 1D dilated causal conv | Receptive field $2^L$ with $L$ layers |
| 2016 | TCN | Dilated causal conv + residual | General temporal conv network |
| 2017 | Transformer | Cross-correlation (attention) | Global "convolution" with learned kernels |
| 2021 | S4 | SSM = implicit IIR conv, trained as FIR via FFT | HiPPO initialization for long-range |
| 2022 | S4D | Diagonal SSM | Simplification: scalar SSM per channel |
| 2022 | FNet | 2D FFT mixing | Fixed unitary conv replaces attention |
| 2023 | Hyena | Parameterized long conv | Data-controlled conv length; sub-quadratic |
| 2023 | Mamba | Selective SSM | Input-dependent scan; best of RNN+conv |
| 2024 | Mamba-2 | State space duality | Connects SSM to linear attention |

The trajectory is clear: convolution is progressively replacing or supplementing attention as the primary mixing mechanism in large-scale sequence models, driven by the $O(N \log N)$ vs. $O(N^2)$ complexity advantage at long sequence lengths.

## Appendix I: Common Signal Pairs and Their Convolutions

Understanding which signals arise as convolutions of common building blocks builds strong intuition.

### I.1 Standard Convolution Pairs

| $f$ | $g$ | $(f * g)$ |
|-----|-----|-----------|
| $\mathcal{N}(\mu_1, \sigma_1^2)$ | $\mathcal{N}(\mu_2, \sigma_2^2)$ | $\mathcal{N}(\mu_1+\mu_2, \sigma_1^2+\sigma_2^2)$ |
| $\Pi_{[0,T]}$ (rect pulse) | $\Pi_{[0,T]}$ (rect pulse) | $\Lambda_{[0,2T]}$ (triangle) |
| $e^{-at}\mathbf{1}_{t\geq 0}$ | $e^{-bt}\mathbf{1}_{t\geq 0}$ | $\frac{e^{-at} - e^{-bt}}{b-a}\mathbf{1}_{t\geq 0}$ (if $a \neq b$) |
| $\delta(t - t_0)$ | $g(t)$ | $g(t - t_0)$ (shift) |
| $\delta'(t)$ | $g(t)$ | $g'(t)$ (derivative) |
| $\operatorname{sinc}(2f_c t)$ | $\operatorname{sinc}(2f_c t)$ | $\operatorname{sinc}(2f_c t)$ (idempotent!) |

The sinc idempotence $(h_{\text{LP}} * h_{\text{LP}} = h_{\text{LP}})$ reflects the fact that the ideal lowpass filter is a **projection**: applying it twice gives the same result as once. In ML terms, this is analogous to idempotent attention patterns.

### I.2 Discrete Convolution Pairs

| $x[n]$ | $h[n]$ | $(x * h)[n]$ |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| $\delta[n]$ | $h[n]$ | $h[n]$ (impulse response) |
| $u[n]$ (step) | $h[n]$ | $\sum_{k=0}^{n} h[k]$ (running sum) |
| $a^n u[n]$ | $b^n u[n]$ | $\frac{a^{n+1} - b^{n+1}}{a - b}u[n]$ |
| $[1, 2, 1]$ | $[1, 2, 1]$ | $[1, 4, 6, 4, 1]$ (binomial expansion) |
| $\cos(2\pi f_0 n)$ | FIR filter $h$ | $|H(f_0)|\cos(2\pi f_0 n + \angle H(f_0))$ |

### I.3 Cascade and Parallel Systems

**Cascade (series):** If system 1 has impulse response $h_1$ and system 2 has $h_2$, the cascade has impulse response $h_1 * h_2$. Frequency response: $H_{\text{cascade}}(f) = H_1(f) \cdot H_2(f)$.

**Parallel:** Impulse response $h_1 + h_2$. Frequency response: $H_1(f) + H_2(f)$.

**Feedback (IIR):** If the forward path has response $H_1$ and feedback has $H_2$:
$$H_{\text{feedback}}(f) = \frac{H_1(f)}{1 - H_1(f)H_2(f)}$$

This is the origin of poles in IIR filters: the denominator $1 - H_1 H_2 = 0$ defines the feedback resonances.
